# React/TypeScript Weather Today App.

[live version here](https://react-weather-typescript.netlify.app)

As part of School of Code I built a weather checker app using TypeScript and React with another bootcamper using pair programming.

### Planning and documentation

We planned the app here [Here](https://github.com/JojokCreator/React-Weather-App---Typescript/blob/main/plan.drawio) and broke the day into mini-sprints/chunks and collectively agree on what work can be completed during each sprint.

### Getting Started
Use the following API to get your weather information: https://openweathermap.org/api. You'll need to sign up for the free tier to get an API key. Rename the .env example to .env and add in your api code after the =.

Run npm install and then npm start. The app should be live on local host 3000.

### Code and functionality

- The app is written in TypeScript.
- The user is able to input the name of a city and have weather information about that city added to the page. 
- We added a dark mode toggle that uses useContext to wrap the app and change CSS styles globally.

## Additional plans

- UI/component libraries - Added a little Mantine UI

- Tests
